Naive flight controller to make a quadrotor hover. Surprisingly easy
to make work using just proportional control and two gyroscopes.

Latest video, [vertical takeoff with little/no drift](https://www.repete.io/vids/marvin-straightup.mp4).

The firmware on the drone is my [`cube-dshot-02` project](https://github.com/petertorelli/cube-dshot-02/).
